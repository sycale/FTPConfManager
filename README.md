Did a config manager without windows job due to my OS, created config manager which chooses default config JSON file instead of xml, there is also an ability to change json and xml options so i didnt implement it into my code but there are such functions that u can inspect (ChangeJsonConfig and ChangeXMLConfig)
<br>
Main Config Files are located in Config Folder, so u can manipulate it over there
<br>
Also there is no many options cuz i didnt see any necessity
